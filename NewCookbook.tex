\chapter{Preface}
This is a book of recipes that I have collected from many sources and adapted to suit the equipment I own, the techniques I am comfortable with, the ingredients that are available where I live, and, most importantly, my own taste.  Some of these recipes are from cookbooks, some are from magazines and newspapers, some are from TV shows, and some are from family and friends.  In many cases I don't know or have forgotten the origin of the recipes. Where I know the source of a recipe I have included it. These are my recipes only in the sense that I like them and make them regularly enough so that I want to record them in a single place.  A few of the recipes are given exactly as I found them, but in most of the recipes I have changed the ingredients or proportions or times or techniques to suit myself.  I have also changed the instructions for some recipes to make them more specific and/or to make the result more pleasing to me. 

Mainly this is a place for me to record my cooking notes so they don't get lost. If you find it useful too, so much the better.

\chapter{Salads}
\recipe{Romaine, Orange, and Pecan Salad}


\ingredients{one head romaine lettuce;
3 tablespoon olive oil;
\half cup whole pecans;
4 oranges cut into supremes;
1 small red onion sliced thin and separated into rings;
\half cup olive oil;
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar;
1 tablespoon lemon juice;
2 teaspoon Dijon mustard;
\half teaspoon sherry;
salt and pepper to taste.}



Prepare the lettuce by separating and washing the leaves.  Place the wet leaves on a clean towel and then roll up the towel and place it in the refrigerator to allow the leaves to become firm and crisp.  When the lettuce is crisp (after 30 minutes or so in the refrigerator), tear the leaves from the center stem and rip the leaves into bite size pieces.  Do not use the stems in the salad.

Saut\'{e} the pecans in olive oil until they are medium brown and then cool on absorbent paper.
  
Prepare the orange slices and the onion slices. 

The remaining ingredients are mixed together to make the vinaigrette dressing. 

Arrange the salad on individual salad plates (or bowls) be placing the prepared romaine on the plates and topping with the orange slices, red onion rings, and saut\'{e}ed pecans.

Fresh herbs such as dill, tarragon, basil, thyme and oregano can be added to the vinaigrette as desired.  Pick one of the above and add 1\half teaspoons to the dressing. Grapefruit supremes can be submitted for orange supremes. 

Yields: Six servings.

\recipe{Hattie B's Black-Eyed Pea Salad}

\ingredients{\\
\\
\textsc{Pepper Vinaigrette --}
\quarter cup champagne vinegar;
\quarter cup malt vinegar;
\half cup extra virgin olive oil;
\half teaspoon minced fresh thyme;
\half teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley;
1/half teaspoons black pepper, freshly ground;
\half teaspoon fine sea salt;
1 red bell pepper, diced small;
1 green bell pepper, diced small;
1 yellow bell pepper, diced small;
2 scallions, finely sliced;
\half teaspoon freshly roasted garlic, minced.\\
\\
\textsc{Black-Eyed Peas --}
2 cups dried black-eyed peas;
4 strips of bacon;
6 cups of chicken stock;
\half teaspoon fine sea salt.
}

Start by making the vinaigrette. Whisk together the vinegars, olive oil, thyme, parsley, black pepper, half the salt, all the peppers, scallions, and garlic.  Let sit in the refrigerator overnight.

In a large pot, add enough water to cover the peas by about 3-4 inches. Let sit overnight while the peppers are marinating. 

The next day, drain the peas in a colander and set aside.  In a large pot over medium-high heat, render the bacon, leaving it whole so it can be easily removed at the end of the recipe.  Once the bacon is rendered, add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.

Once simmering, add the peas and cook on low for about 25 minutes. The peas should be tender but not mushy.  Strain the peas,  remove the strips of bacon, and place in a stainless steel or glass mixing bowl.

While the peas are hot, toss in the vinaigrette and add \half teaspoon of salt.  Taste and adjust seasonings.

Chill completely before serving.

\recipe{Poppy-Seed Dressing}
\label{PoppySeedDressing}

\ingredients{1\half cups sugar;
    2 teaspoons dry mustard;
    2 teaspoons salt;
    \twothirds cup vinegar;
    3 tablespoons onion juice (see note after recipe);
    2 cups canola oil;
    3 tablespoons poppy seeds.}

Mix sugar, mustard, salt, and vinegar. Add onion juice and stir it in thoroughly. Add oil slowly, stirring constantly. Continue to beat until the mixture is thick. Add poppy seeds and mix for a few minutes. Store in a cool place, or in the refrigerator. Makes 3-1/2 cups.

Helen's Note: ``This recipe is easier to make when using an electric mixer or blender, using medium speed, but it can also be made by hand using a rotary beater. The onion juice is obtained by grating a large white onion on the fine side of a grater, or by putting the onion in a blender, then straining the juice. If the dressing separates, pour off the clear part and start over, adding the poppy-seed mixture slowly. It won't separate unless it becomes too cold or too hot. The dressing is delicious on fruit salads of any kind.''

\recipe{Greens}

\ingredients{3 bunches mustard greens;
4 bunches turnip greens;
2 cups water;
\half pound salt pork;
\half stick of butter or 2 tablespoons of rendered bacon fat;
salt and black pepper to taste.}

Cut the salt pork into batons.  Add pork to water in the stock pot set over high heat.  When water comes to a boil reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes or so.

While the pork stock is simmering, prepare the greens for cooking by removing crushed or yellow leaves and cutting off excess stems with the roots.  Wash greens thoroughly in plenty of cold water. Lift leaves from container of water and let sand and grit settle to bottom. Wash through several changes of water until greens are completely clean.

Bring pork stock to a boil then add the greens and stir.  When the greens are wilted, reduce heat and simmer until tender. When tender check the amount of liquid. Pour off and save all but around a cup of liquid.  Add butter or bacon fat and stir.

\recipe{Brooklyn-Style Collard Greens}

\label{BrooklynCollards}


\ingredients{1 smoked turkey wing or 2 medium ham hocks;
3 to 4 bunches collard greens (about four pounds)
salt;
\quarter cup apple cider vinegar;
3 garlic cloves, smashed;
\quarter teaspoon sugar;
1 medium onion, sliced;
\half teaspoon crushed red pepper, more to taste.}

Place turkey wing or hocks in a very large pot and add just 
enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, turn heat to medium 
and simmer until water is reduced by about half.

Meanwhile, plunge greens into a sink full of lightly salted cold water, 
drain and then rinse well with cold fresh water. Trim or remove biggest stems. 
Place five or six leaves on top of one another and roll like a cigar, lengthwise. 
Cut collards into inch-wide ribbons, then, keeping collards rolled,
cut ribbons in half.

Turn heat under pot to high. Add vinegar, one teaspoon salt and the garlic,
then add as many greens as pot will hold. Wait until greens cook down, 
then add remaining greens. Turn heat to a simmer, cover and cook until greens
 for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add sugar, onion and crushed red pepper, cover again and continue 
to simmer until tender, another 15 to 30 minutes; 
time will vary depending on toughness of greens. Serve.

\recipe{White Beans with Collards}

\ingredients{1 pound large navy beans (washed and picked over for stones);
2 quarts water;
1 large onion chopped;
1 small (grocery store) bunch of collard greens;
1 pound smoked ham (cubed);
3 cloves garlic (chopped);
1 tablespoon table salt;
1 tablespoon white pepper;
1 whole red pepper;
\half cup olive oil;
1 bay leave.}

Placed washed beans, water, and chopped onion in a large Dutch oven
or small stock pot (at least 6 qts.). Bring beans to boil and then boil for 1 hour.

Remove the stems from the greens using a sharp knife to cut the
green portion of the leaves from both sides of the stem.  Wash the green
portions of the leaves very well to remove all sand and dirt (this may
require moving the leaves back an forth between sinks of clean water).
Take two or three leaf halves and roll into a cigar shape (roll from front
to back of leave). Cut the roll in half along the axis and then perpendicular
to the axis in one inch intervals.

When beans have cooked for 1 hour, add greens to beans along with ham,
garlic, salt, white pepper, and whole red pepper. Stir well, adding olive oil
and bay leave.

Cover pot and let simmer for 30 minutes until both greens and beans are tender.

Notes: In place of the whole red pepper I used a chopped red bell pepper
and added a few teaspoons of very hot hot-sauce. I also added around
3 tablespoons of cider vinegar because I decided it was needed to balance
the richness of the olive oil.  I used smoked ham but I think the dish would be
even better with the ham replaced with smoked pork shoulder.

\recipe{Butter Bean and Ham Soup}
\label{ButterBeanAndHamSoup}
\equilpment{10-quart stock pot; 8-quart polycarbonate food-container;  immersion blender.}

\ingredients{1 ham bone from Honey Baked Ham; 4 quarts water; 2 pounds Camellia Brand dried large limas; 2 large yellow or white onions, chopped; 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped; 2 bay leaves; 1 tablespoon \hyperref[CreoleSeasoning]{Creole seasoning}; olive oil; salt and black pepper to taste.
}


\textsc{This recipe works best if the ham stock is made the day before the soup and allowed to cool overnight in the refrigerator.}

Cut most of the ham off of the ham bone and reserve.  Place the ham bone in the stock pot and add the water.  Bring to a boil and then simmer covered for 1 to 2 hours until the bone separates into two pieces and the attached ham falls off the bone. Remove pot from heat and fish out the bones.  Place the pot in the refrigerator overnight to cool.

In the morning skim off the congealed fat from the top of the ham stock. Strain the stock into  the food-container. Dump out the strainer onto a large cutting board then pick out the ham from the fat and gristle. Shred the ham and add it to the food-container.  

Add olive oil to cleaned stock pot and place over medium heat.  When oil is hot add onions and garlic with a good pinch of salt. Cook stirring occasionally until the onions are lightly browned. While the onions are cooking dice the reserved ham into \quarter inch cubes.  Add olive oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet and use to brown the ham cubes. Add the ham stock and ham cubes to the onions. Sort and rinse the beans and add to the stock along with the bay leaves and Creole seasoning. Bring pot to a boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 1\half hours until the beans are tender. 

With a ladle, remove some beans and liquid and place in the container that came with the immersion blender.  Pur\'{e}e with the immersion blender until smooth and then add back to pot. Stir to combine and evaluate the thickness.  Continue to pur\'{e}e beans until the desired thickness is achieved. Season the soup to taste with salt and black pepper.

For the best balance of flavors, measure the prepped vegetables by weight. Kosher salt aids in grinding the vegetables. The broth base contains enough salt to keep it from freezing solid, making it easy to remove 1 tablespoon at a time. To make 1 cup of broth, stir 1 tablespoon of fresh or frozen broth base into 1 cup of boiling water. If particle-free broth is desired, let the broth steep for 5 minutes and then strain it through a fine-mesh strainer.

Process leeks, carrots, celery root, parsley, minced onions, and salt in food processor, scraping down sides of bowl frequently, until paste is as fine as possible, 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and process for 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl every 20 seconds. Add soy sauce and continue to process 1 minute longer. Transfer mixture to airtight container and tap firmly on counter to remove air bubbles. Press small piece of parchment paper flush against surface of mixture and cover. Freeze for up to 6 months.

To make broth for use, mix 1 tablespoon of base for each cup of boiling water. For example, to make a quart of stock mix 4 tablespoons of base with 1 quart of boiling water.  To make 7 quarts of broth, mix an entire recipe of base with 7 quarts of boiling water.

\recipe{Leftover-Turkey Gumbo}

\ingredients{Leftover turkey carcass with enough leg and thigh meat to make 3 to 4 cups cubed -- a smoked turkey is best.\\
\\
\textsc{Turkey Bone Broth --}
3 ribs celery, roughly chopped;
2 medium onions, roughly chopped; 
4 garlic cloves, smashed;

3 quarts turkey bone broth;
3 tablespoons or so Kitchen Bouquet, optional;
4 cups turkey meat, torn into bite-sized pieces from the turkey carcass and/or leftovers;
\half pound andouille;
salt; freshly ground pepper; ground cayenne; hot sauce; flat-leaf parsley, chopped;
green onions, thinly sliced.
}

Remove as much meat as possible from the turkey carcass; tear into bite-sized pieces. Refrigerate the meat until you are ready to make the gumbo.

To make the turkey bone broth, break up carcass and place pieces on a foil-lined half sheet-pan. Roast at 425 \deg F until bones are browned.

Place the browned carcass pieces in a large stockpot. Scrape all the browned bits and fond from the sheet-pan and add to pot. Add the celery, onions, garlic, thyme, peppercorns and bay leaves. Add one gallon of water.  Add more water if necessary to cover carcass pieces. 

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so that the broth is at a bare simmer. Cook for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. If simmering for an extended time, partially or fully cover the pot. 

Strain the broth through a large colander and discard the solids. Refrigerate until the fat has solidified and can be easily removed. Should yield 3 quarts of stock.  If yield is less that 3 quarts add water to make up the difference. Extra broth can be frozen and used for another purpose.

To make the gumbo, chop and have ready the onions, peppers, celery and garlic. While preparing the vegetables, heat 3 quarts of bone broth in a large saucepan. 

In a heavy skillet brown the sausage then drain on paper towels. When the sausage has cooled, cut the rounds into quarters.

In an 8 cup glass measuring cup combine the flour and the oil.  Using the recipe given elsewhere in these notes, make a very \hyperref[BrownRoux]{dark roux} using the microwave oven. When roux is a deep chocolate color, add the celery, onions, bell pepper, garlic and thyme to the measuring cup, stir until blended, and cook in the roux until the onion is tender. 

Transfer roux to a large cast-iron Dutch oven. Very carefully add hot broth to the roux stirring vigorously until roux is smooth and thin. Add Kitchen Bouquet to achieve desired color. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes. Add the reserved turkey meat and sausage and simmer for 20 minutes.

Season to taste with salt, pepper and cayenne; let simmer another 10 minutes. Check the seasoning and adjust if needed.

Place a mound of cooked rice in each soup bowl, surround with the gumbo, and sprinkle with parsley and scallions.

\recipe{Brown Roux}
\label{BrownRoux}

\ingredients{flour; canola oil or well rendered bacon fat; Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce (optional).}

Combine equal amounts  of flour and oil or fat in an 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup (typically \twothirds cup of each or use the amounts specified in your recipe). Stir well to combine with a long handled wooden spoon.

Microwave on high for 6 minutes.  Carefully remove measuring cup from microwave using a dish towel and stir well being very careful not to splatter any of the hot roux on yourself (it's called Cajun napalm for a reason). The roux should be light brown at this point. Return measuring cup to the microwave and cook on high for 2 minutes then remove again and stir. Return measuring cup to the microwave and cook on high for 1 minute then remove again and stir. Continue this process of cooking for 1 minute and stirring until roux is the desired color. Three or four 1 minute cooking intervals is usually enough to get a dark brown roux. If a very dark roux is desired it may be necessary to reduce the cooking interval to 30 seconds when the roux is dark but not dark enough to avoid burning the roux. If you burn your roux as evidenced by black specks and smoke then toss it out and start over.  Since a roux can be made so quickly in the microwave you haven't lost much time.  With a little practice with your microwave you will be able to turn out perfectly dark roux every time.

Transfer roux to a large cast iron Dutch oven and add the onions, bell peppers, celery, and garlic in the amounts specified in your recipe. Saut\'{e} vegetables for around 5 minutes. The roux will continue to darken and the vegetables will caramelize.

Add stock to roux mixture and stir well.  It the color is not dark enough to suit you then add a tablespoon or more of Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce to achieve the desired color. Professional kitchens add caramelized sugar to color their roux so this is not cheating. If they can do it then you can too. Kitchen Bouquet is made with caramel and caramelized vegetables so it is actually a better way to add color since it adds flavor too.

\recipe{Catfish Pecan with Lemon Thyme Pecan Butter}


\ingredients{3 cups (10 ounces) pecan halves;
1\half cups all-purpose flour;
Creole seafood seasoning, to taste;
1 medium egg;
1 cup milk;
6 catfish fillets, 5 to 7 ounces each;
12 tablespoons (1\half sticks) butter;
3 lemons, cut in half;
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce;
6 large sprigs fresh thyme;
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.}

Place half the pecans, the flour, and the Creole
seasoning in the work bowl of a food processor, and process until
finely ground. Transfer the pecan flour to a large bowl.

Whisk the egg in a large mixing bowl and add the milk. Season both
sides of the fish fillets with Creole seasoning. On e at a time,
place the fillets in the egg wash.

Remove one fillet from the egg wash, letting any excess fluid
drain back into the bowl. Dredge the fillet in the pecan flour and
coat both sides, shaking off any excess. Transfer to a dry sheet
pan, and repeat with the remaining fillets.

Place a large saut\'e an over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the
butter. Heat for about 2 minute, or until the butter is completely
melted and starts to bubble. Place three fish fillets in the pan,
skin side up, and cook for 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to medium,
and cook for another 1\threequarters to 2 minutes, or until the fillets are
evenly brown and crisp. Turn the fish over and cook on the second
side for 2 to 2\half minutes, or until the fish is firm to the
touch and an even brown. The most important factor in determining
the ideal cooking time is the thickness of the fillets you are
using.

Remove the fish, place on a baking rack, wipe the pan clean with a
paper towel, and 2 tablespoons of butter, and repeat with the
remaining pieces of fish.

When a all the fish fillets are cooked, wipe the pan, and return
the heat to high. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons of butter and,
just as the butter turns brown, and the remaining 1\half cups of
pecans and saut\'e or 2 to 3 minutes or until the nuts are toasted,
stirring occasionally. Put the lemons face down in the pan, first
squeezing a little juice from each piece. Add the Worcestershire
and the fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 30
seconds more or until thyme starts to wilt and becomes very
aromatic.

Place one fish fillet and a lemon piece on each of six dinner
plates, spoon some pecan better around each piece of the fish, and
use the wilted thyme to garnish the piece.

\recipe{Shrimp in Cashew-Yogurt Sauce}
\ingredients{1 to 1\quarter pounds large (16-20 count) frozen shrimp, shell-on and deveined;
5 tablespoons unsalted butter;
1 medium onion;
2 cloves garlic;
\half teaspoon chili powder, plus more as needed;
\half teaspoon ground cumin;
1 teaspoon ground turmeric;
\half teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed;
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper; 
1 cup roasted, unsalted cashews;
2 cups plain Greek yogurt, preferably full-fat}

Place the shrimp (to taste) in a bowl of tap water and let them defrost a bit while you prep the butter. When you can, pull off the tails and reserve.

Melt the butter in the pot, over medium-low heat. As soon as white milk solids form on the surface, skim off and discard them. The butter should be mostly golden and clear; you have clarified it enough for this dish.

Add the reserved shrimp tails; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring once or twice. (You are infusing the butter with shrimp flavor!)

Meanwhile, peel the shrimp; it's okay if they are not fully defrosted. Cut the onion into small dice. Mince the garlic.

Remove the shrimp tails from the pot and discard, then stir in the onion and garlic. Increase the heat to medium; cook for 3 or 4 minutes until just softened, stirring a few times, then add the chili powder, cumin, turmeric, salt and pepper, stirring to incorporate. Add half the cashews.

Add the yogurt, stirring to form a thick sauce; cook for 2 or 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low.
 
Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture right in the pot.

Drain the shrimp and add them to the pot, along with the remaining cashews. Increase the heat to medium; cook for about 4 minutes, stirring to make sure all the shrimp is pink and no longer translucent. Taste and add more salt and/or chili powder, as needed.

Divide among wide, shallow bowls. Sprinkle each portion with a little chili powder, and serve warm.

Makes four servings when served over rice. Attractive when topped with strips of roasted red bell pepper.

Arrange the split hens meat side up in a deep roasting pan.  Be sure that the hens do not touch.  Roast the hens for 35 to 45 minutes in a 375\deg F oven.  Check the drum sticks for doneness.

Transfer the hens to a covered warming pan and keep warm in the oven.  Strain the juice from the cooking pan and reserve for use in the sauce in the next step.

The remaining ingredients and the pan juices are used to make the sauce.  Because this is a reduction sauce, all the remaining ingredients should be prepared and measured before beginning the sauce.

In a wide, non-reactive skillet placed over high heat, add the vinegar, vermouth, and chopped shallots and boil until nearly dry.

Add the lemon or lime juice and the pan juices and reduce by one half.

Add the chicken stock to the pan and reduce by one half again.

Add the cream to the sauce and cook down to the consistency of maple syrup.

Finish the sauce by adding the mustard, tarragon, and butter.

Remove the hens from the warming pan and place on the serving platter.  Surround the hens with the broccoli and carrots and drizzle the sauce over the hens.  Serve the remaining sauce in a sauce boat.

I learned to make this from my friend Rosa Rajkovic during my time in Albuquerque, NM.  The reduction sauce that accompanies the game hens is very rich.  As a result, I usually serve this with a simple garnish of steamed baby carrots and/or broccoli on the serving platter and nothing but this and bread for the main course.  I have made several variations of this recipe.  These include replacing the vermouth with red port or Madeira and replacing the white vinegar with red.  Instead of roasting the marinated game hens they can be grilled and the sauce made without the pan juices.  Serves 8 (half a game hen per person is usually enough if a meal with a vegetable garnish, salad, bread, and desert is served).

\recipe{Garlic-Lime Grilled Pork Tenderloin Steaks}

\ingredients{2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed;
1 tablespoon grated lime zest plus 1/4 cup juice (2 limes);
4 garlic cloves, minced;
4 teaspoons honey;
2 teaspoons fish sauce
\threequarters teaspoon salt;
\half teaspoon pepper; 
\half cup vegetable oil;
4 teaspoons mayonnaise;
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro;
Flake sea salt (optional)}

Slice each tenderloin in half crosswise (perpendicular to the long axis) to create 4 steaks total. Pound each half to 3/4-inch thickness. Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep slits spaced 1/2 inch apart in crosshatch pattern on both sides of steaks.

Whisk lime zest and juice, garlic, honey, fish sauce, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle oil into lime mixture until smooth and slightly thickened. Transfer 1/2 cup lime mixture to small bowl and whisk in mayonnaise; set aside sauce. Add steaks to bowl with remaining marinade and toss thoroughly to coat; transfer steaks and marinade to large zipper-lock bag, press out as much air as possible, and seal bag. Let steaks sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.

Completely open the bottom vents of a charcoal grill. Light a large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.

Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the white sugar and 1 cup of the salt together in another bowl, then rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
    
When you're ready to cook, heat oven to 300\deg F. Remove pork from refrigerator and discard any juices. Place the pork in a roasting pan and set in the oven and cook for approximately 6 hours, or until it collapses, yielding easily to the tines of a fork. (After the first hour, baste hourly with pan juices.) At this point, you may remove the meat from the oven and allow it to rest for up to an hour.
    
Meanwhile, make the ginger-scallion sauce. In a large bowl, combine the scallions with the rest of the ingredients. Mix well and taste, adding salt if needed.
    
Make the ssam sauce. In a medium bowl, combine the chili pastes with the vinegar and oil, and mix well.
    
Prepare rice, wash lettuce and, if using, shuck the oysters. Put kimchi and sauces into serving bowls.
    
When your accompaniments are prepared and you are ready to serve the food, turn oven to 500\deg F. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining tablespoon of salt with the brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the cooked pork. Place in oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until a dark caramel crust has developed on the meat. Serve hot, with the accompaniments.

\chapter{Pizza}
\recipe{Neapolitan Pizza Dough}

\ingredients{500 grams Antico Caputo brand 00 wheat flour;
310 grams water;
10 grams salt;
10 grams agave syrup;
2.5 grams (1\half teaspoons) Bob's Red Mill brand vital wheat gluten;
2.5 grams (\threequarters teaspoon) Active dry yeast;
Neutral oil as needed.}

Mix flour, water, salt, agave syrup, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook until fully incorporated.

Mix on medium speed (4 on KitchenAid mixer) for 5 minutes.

Let the dough rest in the bowl for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then mix again for another 5 minutes at medium speed.
Allowing the gluten to relax between kneading creates an especially smooth, stretchy dough.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface, and cut into four equal weight chunks. Stretch and roll the dough into smooth, even balls.
Stretching the surface layer develops a network of gluten that traps air inside the ball, resulting in a lighter, more blistered crust.

Coat the balls lightly with oil, cover them with plastic wrap, and allow them to rise at room temperature for 1 hour before using. For a more complex flavor,
refrigerate the dough balls overnight, and then let them rest at room temperature for 1 hour before using.

Yields enough dough for four 12-14 inch pizzas.  The dough keeps for 3 days when refrigerated in plastic wrap or up to 3 months when frozen.

\\
\textsc{Tart Pastry --} 1\quarter all purpose flour;
pinch of salt;
\half cup (1 stick) unsalted butter;
1 to 3 Tablespoons ice cold water.\\
\\
\textsc{Almond Filling --} 100 grams unsalted butter;
100 grams almond flour;
100 grams sugar;
1 egg;
1 tablespoon all purpose flour;
1 tablespoon dark rum or kirsch.}

To poach the pears first make a syrup by bring the water and sugar to boil in a saucepan. Peel pears, cut in half, then remove stem and seeds. Poach pears in simmering syrup until cooked through but still firm enough to hold together. Remove pear halves from syrup and allow to cool. Cook down syrup until reduced to a glaze then cool and reserve glaze. 

Preheat the oven to 425\deg F.

To make the tart pastry, place the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Cut in the butter in slices, and buzz several times until the mixture is uniform and resembles coarse meal.  Continue to process in quick spurts as you add water, 1 tablespoon at at time. As soon as the dough adheres to itself when pinched together, stop adding water, turn it out onto a floured surface, and push it together into a ball. 

Butter the tart pan then roll the dough into an 11-inch or so circle. Drape the dough over your rolling pin and the lift the dough into the tart pan, nudging it gently into the corners, and use your hands to form an even edge all the way around. Prick the dough all over with the tines of a fork. Wrap tightly and store in the refrigerator until assembly. 

To make the filling, mix butter, sugar, and almond flour, until the dough is smooth, add the rum, then the beaten egg. Work until the mixture is homogeneous, then add the flour and mix completely.

To assemble tart place poached pears radially around the center of the tart pan with the cut sides down and the stems pointed at the center. Pour the filling evenly around the pears leaving most of the pear exposed. Bake for 45 minutes then remove from oven and pour reserved glaze evenly over tart.  The tart will absorb the glaze after a few minutes so you can continue to pour over glaze until it is all used.  Let cool to room temperature before removing from the pan and serving.

\quarter cup sugar;
1\quarter teaspoons salt;
1 tablespoon instant yeast}

In a heavy duty mixer with the dough hook attached, mix and then knead all of the dough ingredients to make a soft, smooth dough.

Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, or until it's nearly doubled in bulk.

Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball; flatten to about 3 inches across. Place the buns on a silicon baking mat in a half sheet pan, cover, and let rise for about an hour, until noticeably puffy.

Bake the buns in a preheated 375\deg F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden.

Brushing buns with melted butter will give them a soft, light golden crust. Brushing with an egg-white wash (1 egg white beaten with 1/4 cup water) will give them a shinier, darker crust. For seeded buns, brush with the egg wash; it'll make the seeds adhere. And, feel free to add the extra yolk to the dough, reserving the white for the wash.

Yield: 8 large buns.

\equilpment{14 cup heavy-duty food processor; 6 quart Dutch oven}
\ingredients{1 pound dried chickpeas;
2 teaspoons baking soda;
12 cups (3 quarts) water;
16 ounce jar Soom tahini;
8 tablespoons (4 ounces or \half cup) lemon juice;
8 cloves garlic, pealed;
1 tablespoon salt;
6 to 7 ounces ice-cold water}

The night before, put the chickpeas in a large bowl and cover them with cold water at least twice their volume. Leave to soak overnight.

The next day, drain the chickpeas. Place a Dutch oven over high heat and add the drained chickpeas and baking soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil. Cook at a rolling boil, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface. The chickpeas will need to cook between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.

Drain the chickpeas. Place the chickpeas in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste. Then with the machine still running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and allow it to mix for about 5 minutes, until you get a very smooth and creamy paste.

Refrigerate or freeze in 1 or 2 cup portions. Cover the surface of the hummus with plastic wrap to avoid the formation of a skin. Defrost frozen hummus in the refrigerator overnight. Allow refrigerated hummus to come to room temperature before serving by leaving is on the counter for 30 minutes.

Makes approximately 8 cups.

\recipe{Pickled Eggs}
\textsc{My mother, Mallette Goggans, often made these eggs for parties.  Her recipe uses 15 dozen peewee eggs and a gallon of vinegar. I have scaled her recipe down to one dozen medium eggs so that it fits in a single one-quart canning jar. The beet in the recipe is just for color and can be omitted. When placing the eggs in the jar try to stand then up and place onions around then so that they do not touch the side of the jar.  That way the eggs will be uniformly colored and pickled. Pickled eggs may be kept several months in the pickling solution in the refrigerator.  The  eggs can be drained and served as is or sliced in half and used to make deviled eggs. }

\ingredients{12 medium eggs, hard cooked and pealed;
2 cups cider vinegar;
2 tablespoons sugar;
1 teaspoon table salt;
4 peppercorns;
3 whole cloves;
1 teaspoon  whole celery seeds;
1 medium red beet, grated (optional);
1 small onion, sliced in rings;
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced;
1 teaspoon caraway seeds;
sprig or two of fresh dill.
}

Combine vinegar, sugar, salt peppercorns, cloves, celery seeds and grated beet in a sauce pan and bring to a simmer.  Simmer picking liquid for around 5 minutes then strain reserving liquid.

While pickling liquid is simmering, layer eggs, onions, garlic and dill in a one-quart wide-mouth canning jar.  Sprinkle caraway seeds over eggs in jar then pour strained liquid over eggs, onions, and garlic until covered. Place lid and ring on jar and tighten.  Place jar in the refrigerator  and marinate for at least 2 days although 2 weeks is better.

\chapter{ Charcuterie}
\recipe{Sausage and Chicken Liver P\^{a}t\'{e}}

\ingredients{1 pound raw thin sliced bacon strips;
1 pound chicken liver;
1 pound ground pork breakfast sausage;
2 large eggs;
2 or 3 cloves of garlic;
1 medium onion diced;
1 tablespoon diced parsley;
1 tablespoon brandy or cognac (Optional or use 3 tablespoons sherry);
1 teaspoon thyme;
1 teaspoon salt;
\eighth teaspoon black pepper;
\eighth teaspoon rosemary;
3 or 4 whole bay leaves for top of p\^{a}t\'{e}.}

Put a parchment paper sling in a 6 to 8 cup p\^{a}t\'{e}  mold (a bread pan works fine) and then line the mold with the
raw bacon strips letting the ends flop over the sides of the mold.  Use whole strips of bacon across the short side of the mold just overlapping the strip.  On the ends of the long side of the mold use bacon strip cut in half.  The sling is used to as an aid when unmolding the p\^{a}t\'{e} and is particularly important if a glass mold is used since in this case the mold can not be slammed against the platter without risk of breaking the glass.

Place all of the remaining ingredients except for the bay
leaves in a food processor or blender and process until liquefied.

Pour the liver mixture into the p\^{a}t\'{e} mold, top with the bay
leaves, and fold the end of the bacon over the mixture.

Cover the mold with foil and bake at 225 \deg F for 3 hours.  The internal temperature should be greater than 160 \deg F.

Remove from oven and pour off the excess fat from the p\^{a}t\'{e}.  As long as the specified internal temperature is reached, you should not be concerned if the excess fat you pour off is a little pink. Place a brick or
other heavy object on top of the foil to press the p\^{a}t\'{e} and leave
in the refrigerator overnight.

Unmold p\^{a}t\'{e} onto a platter
and garnish with greenery or strips of roasted red and/or yellow
bell pepper.  Serve with slices of \hyperref[SweetPickles]{sweet pickle} and Dijon mustard
on French bread.

Place bag with pork mixture in freezer for around 30 minutes then ground mixture using a 4.5 mm plate. Grind directly into the bowl of a KitchenAid mixer. Feed a piece of stale bread through the grinder to force out any remaining bits of sausage. 

Add 2 ounces of water to the bowl. With the mixer's paddle attachment, mix the sausage on medium-low speed until homogeneous and tacky, about 2 minutes. Load sausage into stuffer. 

Place open end of casing on the end of the kitchen faucet and inflate with water until fully inflated. Drain and place on medium stuffer tube. Tie a knot in the end of the casing and evenly fill with sausage. Stop before the end of the casing and tie off with another knot.  Divide into links and twist to separate. 

Makes around 16 links.

\recipe{Texas German Sausage}
\label{TexasSausage}
\equilpment{KitchenAid Mixer; LEM \#5 Electric Meat Grinder; LEM Mighty Bite Sausage Stuffer; KBQ C-60 BBQ Smoker.}

\ingredients{4\quarter pounds beef brisket;
\threequarters pounds pork shoulder;
30 grams Kosher salt;
\half teaspoon ground cayenne pepper;
3 tablespoons fresh and coarsely ground black pepper;
4 grams cure \#1;
4 3-foot sections of natural hog casings for sausage (e.g. Natural Hog Casings for Sausage by Oversea Casing);
\threequarters cups water;
1 ounce dry milk powder;
 split oak logs for smoking.}

\textsc{This is my attempt produce East Texas style German sausage like the Original Smoked Sausage made by Kreuz Market in Lockhart, Texas. According to their web site, Kreuz sausage is 85\% beef and 15\% pork, smoked using post oak, and seasoned using only salt, pepper and cayenne. This recipe has the same percentages of beef and pork as Kreuz sausage, is smoked using oak, and is seasoned with salt, black pepper and cayenne.}

Cut the brisket and pork shoulder into one-inch cubes.

In a large metal or glass bowl, combine the meat cubes with the salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and cure \#1.

Mix thoroughly with gloved hands, making sure the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the meat. Transfer to a two-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Rinse salt off casings and place in a bowl with cold water to soak.  Casings should soak for around 30 minutes.

Place bag with beef and pork mixture in freezer for around 30 minutes then grind mixture using a 10 mm plate. Grind directly into the bowl of a KitchenAid mixer. Feed a piece of stale bread or a sheet of paper towel through the grinder to force out any remaining bits of sausage. Grind the meat mixture a second time with the 4.5 mm plate.

Add water and milk powder to the mixer bowl containing the ground meat. With the mixer's paddle attachment, mix the sausage on medium-low speed until homogeneous and tacky, about 2 minutes. Load sausage into stuffer. 

Place open end of casing on the end of the kitchen faucet and inflate with water until fully inflated. Drain and place on small stuffer tube. Tie a knot in the end of the casing and evenly fill with sausage. Stop before the end of the casing and tie off with another knot.  Divide into links and twist to separate. 


There are a few different ways to create individual sausage links depending on the look you desire for your final product. You can use butcher twine to tie square knots between the links. Another option is to simply twist the casing several times to create individual links. This method works especially well for natural casing.

Arrange the sausage links on a half-sheet pan  then place the pan in refrigerator on the bottom shelf to chill before smoking. If it is convenient you can leave the sausages in the refrigerator overnight and smoke them the next day. Pull the sausages out of the refrigerator an hour before smoking in order to allow the casings to dry at room temperature.

Start a fire in the KBQ C-60 smoker and preheat to 160\deg F. Half open the upper and lower smoke selector outlets on the  smoker.  When the temperature in the smoker is stable, place the sausage links on racks around the middle of the smoker. Cook until  the sausages reach an internal temperature of 154\deg F.  The sausages will take about 3 hours to reach the desired temperature.
   
Once the sausages are out of the smoker, it is important to cool them down as quickly as possible to avoid shriveled skins. Do this by placing the links in a cold water bath until they are room temperature or slightly cooler.


Blooming, or allowing the sausages to develop flavor at room temperature, is an important final step before enjoying your sausages. Hang them on a rack suspended between the backs of two chairs or any setup where they will have plenty of air exposure. The smoky flavor will continue to develop and spread throughout the sausage for a few hours. 

After blooming, you should store the finished sausage in a refrigerator where it will keep for 3-4 days. If you vacuum seal the sausages, they will last in a freezer for up to nine months.

Makes around 5 pounds of links.

To serve the sausages, preheat oven to 275\deg F, place the sausages in oven and heat for 10 to 20 minutes. Or, even better, brown on a grill over lump charcoal. By the time the sausages are browned all over they will be heated through.

\recipe{Good Eats Roast Turkey}

\ingredients{14 to 16 pound fresh turkey; 2 cups kosher salt; 2 gallons \hyperref[VegetableBroth]{vegetable broth};
1 cup light brown sugar;
2 tablespoons black peppercorns;
3 tsp. allspice berries; 3 tsp. chopped candied ginger; 2 gallons heavily iced water;
1 red apple, sliced; \half onion, sliced; 1 cup water; 4 sprigs rosemary; 6 leaves sage; Canola oil
}
\textsc{This version of the recipe has ingredient amounts to make twice the amount of brine called for in the original recipe.  You may be able to use half this amount of brine if you brine your turkey in a small cooler that tightly fits your turkey instead of using a 5-gallon plastic bucket.}

To make the brine, combine the vegetable stock, salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and candied ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve solids and bring to a boil. Then remove the brine from the heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate.  

Combine the brine, water and ice in the 5-gallon food-safe plastic bucket (a brewing pail for example). Place the turkey (with innards removed) breast side down in brine. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed, cover, and refrigerate or set in cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once half way through brining.

Set the oven rack to it lowest level and preheat the oven to 500 \deg F. Remove the bird from brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard the brine. 

Place the bird on wire rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper towels.


Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped aromatics to the turkey's cavity along with the rosemary and sage. Tuck the wings underneath the bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil.  

Fold an 18'' foil square in half along the diagonal to form a right isosceles triangle. Coat one flat side of the triangle with Canola oil and then form to the breast of the turkey with the 90\deg angle pointed to the front of the bird and the 45\deg angles pointing at the wings.  Remove the foil triangle without bending it and set aside.


Put the turkey in the oven with legs first if it will fit this way. Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven at 500 \deg F for 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 \deg F. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and place the foil triangle on the breast.  Set the thermometer alarm to 161 \deg F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 \half hours of roasting. Let the turkey rest, loosely covered with foil for at least 15 minutes before carving. Alternatively, the cooked turkey can be held for up to an hour in a large closed cooler.  Place the turkey on a serving plater and then place the plater in the cooler. Cover the turkey with foil before closing the cooler.

\recipe{Corn Bread Oyster Dressing}

\ingredients{12 tbsp. butter;
1 large yellow onion finely chopped;
4 celery stalks finely chopped;
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley;
1 tsp. dried sage;
1/2 tsp. dried tarragon;
1 recipe of corn bread made with Martha White self-rising corn 
              meal mix (white corn), crumbled;
2 eggs;
Pinch cayenne;
Salt and freshly ground black pepper;
Crisco;
Chicken Stock (less than 1 cup needed);
1 pt. to 1.5 pt. shucked Gulf oysters (3 dozen small shucked oysters).}

Make corn bread in a cast iron skillet using melted Crisco in place of oil.
Grease skillet generously with Crisco and preheat in oven before adding 
batter so that the corn bread develops a thick brown crisp crust. 
Cool corn bread and then crumble. Two cups of corn meal mix made into
corn bread should yield around 6 cups of crumbled corn bread.

Preheat oven to 350 \deg F.  Melt 6 tbsp. of butter in a skillet over medium heat, 
add onions, celery, parsley, sage, tarragon, and cayenne.  Sweat the mixture 
until the vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes, then cool.

Drain and reserve the oyster liquid.  If using large oysters cut each oyster 
into 2 or 3 pieces.  Measure the oyster liquid and add enough chicken stock 
(or water) to bring the total to 1 cup.  Transfer liquid to a small sauce pan, 
add the remaining 6 tbsp. of butter, then bring to a simmer, stirring until 
butter has melted.

In a large mixing bowl, lightly beat 2 eggs then add the crumbled corn bread
and mix to combine.  Add vegetable mixture, season with salt (around 1 tbsp. 
if you use unsalted butter) and pepper (1 tsp. or more to taste) 
then mix to combine.  Pour the liquid/butter mixture over the corn bread 
mixture and combine by working with hands.  The mixture should be
uniformly moist but not wet. Add additional chicken stock if mixture is too dry.
Finally, gently mix oysters into corn bread mixture, taking care not 
to break up the oysters.

Transfer mixture to a greased approximately 64 sq. in. cast iron baking dish
or tall cast iron skillet.  Bake for approximately 40 minutes until firmly set 
and browned on top.  Remove from oven and cover with foil to keep 
warn until ready to serve.

Yields 8 generous servings.
Notes

I made a double recipe for Thanksgiving 2012.  
For the double recipe I used my blue Le Creuset baking pan both to make the 
corn bread and to make the dressing.  For the double recipe I increased the 
cooking time to 60 minutes and finished browning the top using the broiler 
on high for a minute or two.

I made a single recipe for Thanksgiving 2014. I used my black high sided Le Creuset baking pan. In this pan I cooked the recipe for 55 minute and then browned the top under the broiler on high.  I used 4 or 5 dozen large oysters cut in half. I had enough oyster liquid and so did not need the chicken stock.

1 teaspoon baking soda;
1 teaspoon salt.}

\textsc{Around 1967 my father, Floyd Goggans, planted a dwarf Tanenashi
persimmon tree in the yard of the house at Kuderna Acres.  Every
year the persimmons ripened just in time to make persimmon pudding
for Thanksgiving dinner. My mother,  Mallette Goggans, often served this pudding with
a hard sauce made with bourbon.  I use the hard sauce recipe from
Joy of Cooking made with rye whisky and cream. Be sure to use
truly ripe persimmons.  A ripe persimmon is very soft. Its pulp is
like a thick gel and contains no solid bits.}

In mixing bowl combine all ingredients stirring until blended.

Pour mixture into a 8 cup metal mold. The pudding will
rise when cooked so do not completely fill the mold.

Place uncovered mold inside a large covered pot.

Pour boiling water in the pot to slightly below the top of the mold.

Adjust the stove top so that the water in the pot simmers slowly.

Cover the pot and then steam the pudding until it has a cake-pudding
texture.  This step will take around 3 hours.

Remove pudding and cool in refrigerator.

\ingredients{4 kg sugar;
250 g wheat bran;
1 Multivitamin tablet;
pinch Epsom salts;
\half teaspoon diamonioum phospate (DAP);
\half teaspoon Citric acid;
50 g bakers yeast.}

\textsc{This recipe makes 23 liters or 6.1 gallons.}

In a large pot (6  or more quarts) bring 3 quarts of water to the boil. Add the 250 g of bran, stir, bring back to the boil then simmer for 30 minutes stirring from time to time. When cooked the bran and water becomes a thin porridge.

Dissolve the sugar in warm water and add to the fermenter with cool water to bring quantity up to 20 litres. Add the crushed MV tab, Epsom salts and DAP.

Once the bran has simmered for 30 minutes, add it to the fermenter.

Adjust the pH to around 5 with the citric acid. This usually takes about \half teaspoon of citric acid.

Rehydrate the yeast in 100ml water and add to the mix. Making sure the start temp is below 30\deg C = 86 \deg F.

Stir well ( I use a stick blender to thoroughly aerate it.)

Leave plenty of headroom as this takes off like a rocket. I use a 30l fermenter
Do NOT seal for at least 24 hours as a thick foamy cap will form within an hour. I put it under an airlock only after 36 hrs so I can monitor progress.

This produces a fast ferment (normally dry to .990 within 3 to 4 days). The start specific gravity is around 1.070 so the yeast is not pushed hard to produce off-flavours and the resulting wash is approximately 10\% ABV.

Rack off and allow to stand for a couple of days to clear before distilling.

\recipe{Gin \#2 - In Development}

\ingredients{3\half cups 45\% ABV neutral spirits; 0.5 gram strip of blood orange zest; 15 grams juniper berries; 4 grams coriander seeds} 

Pour neutral spirits into a 1-quart Mason jar. 

Carefully remove zest from orange being certain that no white pith is included. Trim zest strip until it weighs 0.5 grams.

Using a mortar and pestle thoroughly crush the juniper berries and coriander seeds. 

Add the orange zest, juniper berries and coriander seeds to the neutral spirits, place the lid and ring on the jar, and shake.  Allow the mixture to macerate for around 7 days shaking the jar occasionally.

To distill, remove and discard orange zest then add contents of Mason jar (including juniper berries and coriander seeds) to the Air Still.  Add an additional quart of water to the still. Turn on still and after around 25 minutes collect and discard the first 20 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next approximately 750 ml of distillate. Stop collecting distillate when the measured ABV of the collected distillate is around 45\%. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize. Some distillers suggest that aging the gin several months improves the flavor.

\recipe{Gin \#3 - In Development}

\ingredients{3\half cups 45\% ABV neutral spirits; 0.15 gram dried bitter orange zest; 15 grams juniper berries; 3 grams coriander seeds; 1.5 grams angelica root.} 

Pour neutral spirits into a 1-quart Mason jar. 


Using a mortar and pestle thoroughly crush the juniper berries and coriander seeds. 

Add the dried orange zest, juniper berries, coriander seeds, and angelica root to the neutral spirits, place the lid and ring on the jar, and shake.  Allow the mixture to macerate for around 7 days shaking the jar occasionally.

To distill, add contents of Mason jar plus one quart of water to the Air Still.  Turn on still and after around 25 minutes collect and discard the first 20 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next approximately 750 ml of distillate. Stop collecting distillate when the measured ABV of the collected distillate is around 45\%. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize. Some distillers suggest that aging the gin several months improves the flavor.

\recipe{Fried Okra} 

\ingredients{Cut okra;
egg;
corn meal;
fat for frying;
salt.}

Put cut okra in a bowl. Crack one egg over the okra and then toss to coat. Add corn meal and toss.  The cut ends of the okra should be completely coated with corn meal but some green should be visible on the sides. Deep fat fry in an iron skillet. When brown remove from skillet with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and then serve immediately.

\recipe{Whipped Sour Cream}

\ingredients{sour cream.}

Whip the sour cream just as you would whip sweet cream.  Use as a topping for deserts.

\recipe{Whipped Bacon Fat}

\ingredients{well rendered bacon-fat; herbs or your choice.}

Heat bacon fat until it is in liquid form and then infuse it with herbs or salt and pepper. Take it off the heat and as it's cooling, pour it into a stand mixer and keep whipping it into a lardo-type texture. You can spread it on bread, or make a 50/50 ratio of whipped butter to whipped lardo and use it in place of whipped butter.

\recipe{Soft or Hard Cooked Eggs}

\ingredients{eggs; water.}

The trick to cooking eggs in their shells is to steam rather than boil them. Start with a sauce pan with a tightly fitting lid. The pan should be large enough to hold the number of eggs you want to cook in a single layer.  Add one half inch of water to the pan, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.  Add eggs to pan and cover.  Cook for 6 minutes for soft cooked eggs or 12 minutes for hard cooked eggs.

\recipe{Oven Cooked Bacon}

\ingredients{sliced bacon.}

Preheat oven to 425\deg F. Place bacon strips on a foil covered half sheet pan. Cook in oven for 10 minutes then rotate pan and continue cooking until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes for thin cut or 10 to 15 minutes for thick cut. Remove bacon from oven and drain on paper towels

Yields: Up to as many strips as can be placed on a half sheet pan.



\recipe{Brown Sugar}
\label{BrownSugar}

\ingredients{1 cup white granulated sugar; 1 or 2 tablespoons molasses.}

Combine molasses and white sugar in a small bowl. Use 1 tablespoon of molasses for light brown sugar and 2 tablespoons for dark brown sugar. Mix ingredients with a fork until a uniform mixture is obtained.


\recipe{Warm Bacon-Fat Vinaigrette}
\label{BaconFatVinaigrette}

\ingredients{Well rendered bacon fat;
sherry vinegar.}

Warm the bacon fat until it melts to liquid form and is clear but is not too hot to touch.  Whisk in a splash of sherry vinegar and use to dress an asparagus or other vegetable salad.

\recipe{Miso Mayonnaise}

\ingredients{1 cup mayonnaise; 3 tablespoons white miso; a splash of mirin; a splash of soy sauce; a splash of sambal or chile-garlic sauce.}

 Whisked together ingredients.  The result should be a little less than thick.

\chapter{  Non-Food Recipes}

\recipe{Isotonic Saline Solution}

\ingredients{0.5 liter = 1 pint = 2 cups water;
5 ml = 1 teaspoon salt;
2.5 ml = \half teaspoon baking soda.}

Do not use iodized salt or salt with anti-caking agents.

The water should be boiled and then cooled or bottled water should be used.

I usually make this by boiling the water in the microwave and then adding
the salt and soda to the just off boiling water.

Before using for nasal irrigation let the solution cool to room temperature.

\recipe{Glass Cleaner}

\equilpment{1 gallon plastic jug; funnel.}

\ingredients{\half cup sudsy ammonia; 2 cups rubbing alcohol; 1 teaspoon dish detergent; water to fill; blue food coloring.}

Using a funnel, add all ingredients to the jug except the water and food coloring.  
Slowly add water to fill and then add the food coloring a drop at at time until the desired color is obtained.

\newpage
\recipe{Polishing Silver}

\ingredients{1 gallon water, near boiling;
\half cup baking soda;
disposable aluminum casserole dish;
aluminum foil.}

Add baking soda to aluminum casserole dish and then add near boiling water.  Stir until baking soda is dissolved and then add silver pieces. Wearing rubber gloves, scrub silver pieces with aluminum foil as necessary then rinse and dry.  Add additional silver pieces to dish and repeat steps. This process is less effective as the solution cools. If you will be cleaning a large number of pieces then you can put the aluminum casserole dish in a cast iron casserole dish placed on a cooktop to maintain a solution temperature just under boiling. Discard the aluminum casserole dish when finished.

\recipe{Cleaning Coffee Maker}

\ingredients{10 grams of either baking soda or sodium carbonate.}

If using baking soda first convert it to sodium carbonate by baking it in a 200\deg F oven for one hour.  Mix the sodium carbonate with 1 liter of water and pour into coffee maker's reservoir. Turn on the machine and complete the brew cycle.  After the cycle is complete, rinse all machine components that come into contact with the solution and then repeat the brew cycle twice with clean water.

\recipe{Season a Cast Iron Pan}

\ingredients{Unseasoned or stripped cast iron pan; flaxseed oil.}

If the pan has been previously seasoned then strip it of seasoning by running it through the self-cleaning cycle of a self-cleaning oven. 

To begin seasoning, warm the unseasoned pan for 15 minutes in a 200\deg F oven. 

Remove the pan from the oven.  Place 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove the excess oil. 

Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour.  Turn off the oven and cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours.

\recipe{Bubble Stuff for Giant Bubbles}

\ingredients{1 cup Joy or Dawn dishwashing liquid;
4 tablespoons glycerine (available at most drugstores);
10 to 15 cups cold water.}

Add 10 cups of water to a large pail and then pour in dishwashing liquid.  Add glycerine and then stir gently to avoid creating froth on top of the solution.  When solution is completely mixed, skim off any froth with your hand. On very dry days it may be necessary to add up to 5 cups of additional water to make truly huge bubbles.

\recipe{Four Wire Round Braid}

\ingredients{4 wires of different colors.}

Start with four wires side by side.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take the leftmost wire and cross it OVER its TWO neighbors. 
\item Take the rightmost wire and cross it OVER its NEXT neighbor.
\item Take the leftmost wire and cross it UNDER its TWO neighbors.
\item Take the rightmost wire and cross it UNDER its NEXT neighbor.
\end{enumerate}
Repeat steps 1-4 until done.

\recipe{Fruit Fly Trap}

\ingredients{\quarter cup hot water; 1 tablespoon honey; \half cup apple cider vinegar; 1 teaspoon dishwashing liquid (unscented is best but not necessary)}

In a small bowl combine hot water and honey. Stir with a small whisk until the honey is completely dissolved. Add the cider vinegar and incorporate.  Add dishwashing liquid and whisk slowly to avoid making bubbles.  Add the solution to a small water glass and set on the counter in a area where fruit flies are a problem.

\recipe{Simple Sugar Wash for Distilling}
\label{SimpleWash}
\equilpment{9.5 liter stainless steel stock pot; long handled stainless steel spoon; 12 liter (3 gallon) plastic fermenter with lid and airlock; triple-scale hydrometer; Thermapen digital thermometer; 2 liter (8 cup) pyrex measuring cup; no-wash sanitizing product.}

\ingredients{1.75 kg sugar;
1.5 g citric acid;
1.8 g diamonioum phospate (DAP);
1.3 g food-grade gypsum (calcium sulphate);
150 mg Epsom salts;
16.8 g of distillers yeast or \quarter cup of dried bakers yeast.
}

\textsc{I found this recipe on the Home Distillers Forums under the name ``Wineos Plain Ol Sugar Wash.'' I have scaled the original recipe so that it works in a 12 liter (3 gallon) fermenter.  The target amount of sugar wash is 10.25 liters.  This volume should yield 8 liters of clear wash for distilling.} 

Mark 10.25 liters on the outside of your fermenter. Sanitize your fermenter and top, airlock, stock pot, hydrometer, thermometer probe, measuring cup and spoon before beginning.

In a stainless steel stock pot, bring around  4 liters of water to a simmer then dissolve the sugar in the hot water.  Mix well with a stainless or plastic spoon until the sugar is completely dissolved. In a drinking glass, add hot water and citric acid. Stir the solution until the citric acid is completely dissolved and then add to the sugar solution. Repeat this procedure with the diamonioum phospate, gypsum, and Epsom salts, individually. Stir the sugar solution until all the additions are incorporated.

Add the hot water solution to fermenter. Add cool water (and ice if you are in a hurry -- the ice should all melt) to make the total volume close to but under 10 liters. Using a hydrometer test the specific gravity (be sure to correct for the temperature of the solution). The specific gravity should be above 1.080. Add additional cold water to obtain a  specific gravity between 1.070 and 1.080. After fermentation this will yield between 9.5\% and 11\% alcohol by volume.

Check the temperature of the wash and once it is at or less than 95\deg F sprinkle the yeast on top. After 15-20 minutes, give the wash a good stir to incorporate the yeast and add some air to the wash. Place the cover on the fermenter and add water to the airlock. Place in a storage room or other similar out of the way place at warm room temperature.

Depending on the fermenting temperature this will work off in a week or two. It is important not to rush the fermentation. Let it finish fermenting to a specific gravity of 0.990 or less and then give it another week to clear before racking and running it.  It is important to rack the clear wash off the yeast sediment and only place the clear wash in the still so that a neutral and flavorless spirit is obtained.

% Citric acid 9.9g/T; Gypsum 8.7g/T; DAP 11.9g/T; Red Star distillers yeast 37.1g/\quarter cup; Epson Salts 13.7g/T

% My fermenter: Total Volume = 412 fluid oz = 3.2 gal; Volume below valve = 76 fluid ounces = 0.594 gal = 2.25 l;

% Desired amount of clear wash = 8 l. Target amount of wash to make = 10.25 l = 2.71 gal
